# Graph-Demo
This project implements a weighted, directional graph and simulates a city using graph nodes. The graph can be interacted with using user input.

### The graph can be interacted with in the following ways:
- BFS
- Post-order DFS
- Connected components of a given graph
- Dijkstra's/Shortest path algorithm
- Bipartite evaluator
- Prim's/Minimal spanning algorithm

You must use one of the `WUG` (weighted undirected graph) or `WDG` (weighted directed graph) files to demo the program. The program parses one of these files and constructs a graph from the file's contents.
